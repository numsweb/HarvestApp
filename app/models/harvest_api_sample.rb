# harvest-sample.rb
#
# Basic API demo. Use this sample as a starting point on how to
# connect, authenticate, and send requests to the Harvest API and
# handle the API throttle limit. This is not a libary, if you want one
# for Ruby, we recommend investigating ActiveResource::Base.
#
# To execute this sample, save this file to your computer and 
# run the following command from your console: 
#
#   ruby harvest-sample.rb
#
# You will then see output for the series of action scripted below.
#
# You can also use this as an inspiration for your own integration in
# another language. Basically you just need to send HTTP requests, a
# fairly common task that can be accomplished from nearly all programming
# languages. We receive requests from Python, Javascript, PHP, Perl,
# Java, C# and others.
#
# The full HARVEST API documentation can be found at:
#
#   http://getharvest.com/api
#
# Please review the documentation before sending in your questions.

# Business accounts have ssl support enabled. Set this to false if your
# WEB UI is accessible via http:// instead of https://. Note that
# Harvest will redirect you to the proper protocol regardless of
# this. You just need to handle the redirection pragmatically. This
# sample does this, your implementation should save the last known
